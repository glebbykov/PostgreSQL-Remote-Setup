Logging
The script will create a log file named setup.log in the current directory where the script is running. The log file contains information about the actions performed by the script.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while running the script, please check the log file for more information.

Note
Please make sure that you have the correct permissions to run the script and that all the necessary dependencies are installed before running it.

This script is meant to be a starting point and should be modified to suit your specific needs.

Also, please consider hardening the security of your server by disabling root login, using a non-default port, using firewall rules and other security best practices.
